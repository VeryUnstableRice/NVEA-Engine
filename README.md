 - Why am I making this engine where there are many amazing engine on the market?

I have used multiple engines along the way and none feel right to me. Granted I can get my job done with all of them, but there are issues with all of them. I used Unreal Engine the most and it does have it's flaws since I dislike how it treats high level and low level. This Engine aims exactly what I need, something really light weight which can get the job done. 
- Isn't this engine going to a lot of features that most engines implement for granted?
	
Yes, yes it does. Godot for example got some solid donations and it's still not there. I don't expect my hobby projects to reach anywhere close to even Game Maker, but it is a nice project that can teach me new things, and let form new neuronal pathways. For example the VM language will teach me a lot, I know that for sure.
- Can I participate in this project?(Asked nobody ever)

If you want, you are welcome to make your own branch and make pull requests. If the code meets my standards then sure, go ahead :). But I'm pretty pessimist about this.
- What is the AIM of this engine?

Right now it's just a hobby project. But if it's features get solid, then I will use it for final products. Maybe I will make a 2D story game so I can develop it's 2D side to be game ready.

Current TODO List:
 - [x] Make a proper transform system
 - [x] Create entity system
 - [x] Make a basic Garbage Collector
 - [ ] GUI Lib
 - [ ] Document code
 - [ ] Audio
 - [ ] Networking
 - [ ] Implement either proper garbage collector along with class reflection or VM language or make one for this
The VM solution can work as a high level and the game will not be written in c++, still deciding that
 - [ ] Easy serialization
 - [ ] Sprites
 - [ ] Blendspaces
